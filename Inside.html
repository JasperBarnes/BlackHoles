    <p> A singularity that is the only true thing about a black hole it is a single point with infinite mass and no volume that
         is how it has a gravity strong enogh to keep light from escaping and becuse of this it afects space time causing it so 
         that when you fall it it time slowes for you you see 100s of years pass outside because the gravity is so strong it even efects the flow of time.spagetification where the gravity compreses all of your atoms into its singularity shrinking you into a line that is where it gets its name spagetification as all that enter become a line
