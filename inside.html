     <h1>The inside of a Black Hole</h1>
    <p> A singularity that is the only true thing about a black hole it is a single point with infinite mass and no volume that
         is how it has a gravity strong enogh to keep light from escaping and becuse of this it afects space time causing it so 
         that when you fall it it time slowes for you you see 100s of years pass outside because the gravity is so strong it even efects 
         the flow of time. spagetification where the gravity compreses all of your atoms into its singularity shrinking you into a line 
         that is where it gets its name spagetification as all that enter become a line. 
     of spageti. But this is only one posibility there are many others. Because nothing can escape black holes that means that information
    can"t escape escape them giving us nothing that we can say is certan so we need to use theories and that is how we got the spagetification
     there are others that people have thought of being that there are universes inside the black hole and that we are also in a black hole
    there are alot otheres but the sinularity is still the most popular posibility.
